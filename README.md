Description

This project analyze over 3 milloin grocery orders from instacartto uncover key trends in customer purchasing behaviour, product demand, and reorder patterns. Using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools- Cloud Storage,
Big Query, and Looker Studio- the analysis delivers actionable insights to optimize product placement, inventory, and marketing strategies.

Setup:

We used Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Big Query (SQL Queries) and Data Studio to process and visualize the data.

Steps Followed:

1. Dataset Ingestion to Google Cloud Storage

â€¢ Downloaded the "Instacart" dataset from Kaggle.

â€¢ Created a GCS Bucket to store our raw data file.

â€¢ Uploaded our CSV file i.e. instacartorders.csv

2. Importing Dataset to Big Query (Creating Dataset and Tables)

â€¢ Created a Big Query Dataset "instacart_analysis" to store our Instamaert order data.

â€¢ Imported the CSV file into a Big Query Table "instacart_order" while ensuring proper schema mapping.

3. Wrote the following Queries

5. Building Dashboard in Data Studio:
 
â€¢ Connected Big Query to Data Studio.

â€¢ We used Custom Queries to streamline the linking process with Data Studio.

â€¢ Added scorecards for key KPIs (Total Customers, Total orders, Avg days betwwen order, Reorder ratio, Avg basket size).

â€¢ Added charts and trends for churn segmentation (Most popular products, Top departments by orders, Product order & reorder%).

â€¢ Designed a clean, interactive dashboard for stakeholders.
